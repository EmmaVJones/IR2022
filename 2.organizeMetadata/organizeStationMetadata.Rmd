## Overview

This project picks up after regional assessment staff attribute WQS and AU information to each station identified for inclusion in a given assessment cycle. 

This script combines the WQS and AU information archived by those applications (from the R Connect server) and attaches that information to all data associated with an assessment window.

This script combines all final data, as opposed to draft data.
