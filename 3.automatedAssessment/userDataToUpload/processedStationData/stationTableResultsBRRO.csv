Initially a fall 2005 sediment discharge from a construction site prompted sampling of this site.  The 2005 fall score of 61.3 and 2006 scores spring of 50.9 and fall 60.9 caused assessment decisions to be reserved due to the improvement of scores in fall 2006 and fall 2008 (70.3).  Subsequent 2009 fall survey scored 52.8 and 2012 surveys scored spring 52.5 and fall at 64.9.  The abundance of macroinvertebrates that feed by scraping algae and periphyton (%Scrapers) has always been low indicating a lack of clean substrate or often scoured substrates.  The 2008, 2009, and 2012 habitat surveys find sand and fine sediment impact the stream substrate.  This would indicate continued sources of fines beyond the initial 2005 release.

Due to the improvement of scores in fall 2006 (60.9) and fall 2008 (70.3), VDEQ is reserving judgment until more data can be collected to determine whether, or not, the stream has recovered from the sediment release.

There was a moderate to severe immediate impact to the stream substrate from the sediment release.  Benthic substrates in riffles at this station were found to be 52% embedded by sand and fines in contrast to 30% embeddedness at the control site.

The station is below two hydroelectric dams resulting in daily fluctuations of flow and temperature.  Point and non-point source pollution and sediment appear to affect the river.  This station is downstream of the Lower Smith River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Henry County PSA) that closed in November 2005.  The closure did not appear to have an immediate positive affect on the benthic community.  However, since the last assessment the highest VSCI score (68.59, Spring 2012) is recorded.  The following seasons sample declined well below the non-impaired threshold of VSCI 60 at 49.17.

2010 IR- Bio 'IM' Seven VSCI surveys (2003-2008) with an average score of 57.4.  This station is the furthest downstream biological monitoring site and the first site where the benthic community historically showed signs of recovery.  This site has shown improvement in the Fall scores since Fall 2006, but a decline in the Fall 2008 sample.  Non-point source urban runoff and sediment appear to affect the river.  The station is located downstream of Leatherwood Creek which may be a significant source of sediment.  Recent surveys show that the benthic community is dominated by the moderately tolerant caddisfly Hydropsychidae, an indication of organic and nutrient pollution.  There was some improvement in the benthic community between 1999 and 2001, and 2006 and 2008.  Improved water quality may have been the result of operational improvements at the Martinsville WWTP.  However, the decline in benthic community scores in Spring 2006 and Fall 2008 indicates that water quality is still degraded.

This station is downstream of the Lower Smith River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Henry County PSA) that closed in November 2005.  The closure did not appear to have an immediate positive affect on the benthic community.  However, since the last assessment the highest VSCI score  (68.59, Spring 2012) is recorded.  The following seasons sample declined well below the non-impaired threshold of VSCI 60 at 49.17.

Outside Data Window:
2010 IR- Bio 'IM' Seven VSCI surveys (2003-2008) with an average score of 57.4.  This station is the furthest downstream biological monitoring site and the first site where the benthic community historically showed signs of recovery.  This site has shown improvement in the Fall scores since Fall 2006, but a decline in the Fall 2008 sample.  Non-point source urban runoff and sediment appear to affect the river.  The station is located downstream of Leatherwood Creek which may be a significant source of sediment.  Recent surveys show that the benthic community is dominated by the moderately tolerant caddisfly Hydropsychidae, an indication of organic and nutrient pollution.  There was some improvement in the benthic community between 1999 and 2001, and 2006 and 2008.  Improved water quality may have been the result of operational improvements at the Martinsville WWTP.  However, the decline in benthic community scores in Spring 2006 and Fall 2008 indicates that water quality is still degraded.

Bio 'IM' Five (2009-2011) VSCI surveys.  The average VSCI score is 47.1 indicating an impaired condition.  Instream habitat (substrate) has been impacted by fine sediment.  Riparian zone vegetation has been removed and stream banks eroded due to unrestricted cattle access to the stream.  This region was affected by several drought years in earlier assessments.  Less runoff of non-point source pollution during the low rainfall periods potentially resulted in an improvement in the benthic community.  Additionally, recent installation of agricultural best management practices in the watershed have improved water quality.  The Soil and Water Conservation District is implementing agricultural best management practices in the watershed.

2018 IR Bio 'IM' from 6 VSCI surveys (2012, 2014, 2015) with an average score of 59.5. Previous assessments observed that the benthic community declined overall from Fall 2003 to the Fall 2005 survey and that it improved during Spring and Fall 2004 before declining in the Fall of 2005. Data collected during the 2014 assessment period show that 3/4 samples were above the impairment threshold with an average VSCI score of 60.2. Additional data collected in 2014 show an improvement in the Spring score and a decline below the impairment threshold in the Fall. The Spring 2015 sample declined compared to the 2014 Spring score and the Fall 2015 score improved well above the impaired threshold. While the 6-yr avg is approaching the non-impaired threshold, the Spring score is well below the impaired threshold. The variability of the benthic community between Spring and Fall seasons and the consistently low Spring scores indicates stress and an impaired benthic community.

One sample was below the impairment threshold (spring 2012 - 51.2) and one above (fall 2012 - 63.9). The 2016 assessment finds all spring scores were lower than fall scores.

For 7 seasons samples were not collected at this station. The eighth and ninth seasons the VSCI scores were non-impaired.

Bioassessments at this station have shown a slight decline from fall of 2007 to spring 2008 and show a recovery in the benthic community in the last sample collected. Bioassessments at this station have shown a slight decline in the benthic macroinvertebrate community over the last several years. Fluctuating flows from Philpott Dam have an effect on the community. During recent surveys, it appears that sediment deposition has increased in this reach of the Smith River. Aerial photographs have shown areas of recent logging in the Reed Creek watershed. This is possibly a result of the upstream scouring caused by discharges from Philpott Dam as well as inputs from tributaries such as Reed Creek.

2008 Cycle: E.coli geometric mean exceeds the former WQS criterion in 1/5 calculations.

Bio 'FS' The average Stream Condition Index (SCI) score at this station was 60.1 (range: 50.97-65.08). Hydropsychid caddisflies historically dominated during fall surveys. Hydropsychidae are semi-tolerant of organic/nutrient enrichment. However, Ephemerellid mayflies have dominated the last 2 fall surveys, indicating sedimentation as a potential stressor.

Device recorded temp every 30 min for 30 days. 2016 IR reveals 20% of the days exceeded the max daily temp at least 10.5% of the day for the Class VI Natural Trout criterion of 20°C. The rate of temperature change (0.5°C per hour) was exceeded 72.4% of the days the temperature sensor was deployed. These temperature exceedances are believed the result of the hydroelectric operations and flow release patterns from the Philpott Dam. 2016 flow adjusted trend analysis: degrading E.coli and specific conductance; improving DO and TN.

2016 IR:   Bio 'IM' The 2016 assessment records 12 VSCI surveys (2009-2014) with an average score of 55.5.  Spring bioassessments at this station show a decline since 2009 and Fall bioassessments show a slight improvement since 2009.  Overall VSCI scores are declining.  Similar to station 4ASRE031.00, this reach of the river is impacted by the operation of one hydroelectric dam, sediment deposition and urban NPS runoff.  Sediment deposition in this reach of the Smith River may negatively affect the benthic community.  This is possibly a result of the upstream scouring caused by discharges from Philpott Dam as well as inputs from major tributaries.

Compared to upstream and downstream sites on Stony Creek the benthic community at this station has lower VSCI scores that appear to be driven partially by feeding modes of the organisms.  There are usually lower numbers of organisms that are called Scrapers (scrape periphyton from clean substrates) and higher numbers of Hydropsychid caddisflies which are filter feeders (build nets to collect fine organic matter).

Bio 'FS' one 2010 VSCI spring survey scoring 70.5.  This reach is sometimes dewatered in the fall resulting in limited seasonal variability in assessments.  In fall 2010, there was no water in the stream channel.  Historically, when flows are available to sample in the fall, the community consists of sensitive organisms and has been dominated by mayfly and stonefly families.  In summer 2005, a truck carrying hydrated lime wrecked in Stony Creek killing fish throughout this reach.  This reach was dry in fall 2005 and could not be sampled.  The community assemblage in the spring 2010 sample appears similar to historical springtime assemblages indicating no long-lasting effects from the truck wreck.

Two 2011 VSCI surveys were unsuitable for assessment. The benthic assemblage collected at this site indicates tolerance to acid stream conditions (pH = 5.4) as well as intermittent/headwater stream conditions (low numbers of mayflies and low %Scrapers).  The spring sample resulted in only 12 organisms collected in a 2 m2 area of substrate; whereas, several hundred organisms are typically collected with similar effort.  Due to the low number collected, an assessment score could not be calculated.  The fall 2010 sample had a low density of benthic macroinvertebrates but enough to calculate an SCI score.  This assemblage was dominated by Stoneflies from the family Capniidae (genus Allocapnia) which are tolerant of acid conditions and intermittent stream flow.  
The stream substrates at this site were stuck together by what appeared to be iron bacteria that had dried when the stream was dry.  Local residents said the stream was dry until a rain event one-two weeks prior to the fall 2010 survey.

However, shortly above the sample site, the property had historically been used as a saw mill but that area is currently vegetated.  The stream currently flows through two culverts that allow for driveway crossings immediately above the sample reach.  Within the sample reach, the stream has poor instream habitat as indicated by mostly low scores for substrate, velocity, and sediment.  The channel has been altered from its natural shape.  The immediate bank vegetation is mowed down to the water line and the riparian vegetation has been completely removed.

4AROA215.13- Bio 'FS'  Three VSCI spring surveys (2009, 2010 & 2012) and one 2012 Fall score of 72.2; with an average score of 62.9.  Benthic community analyses result in good biological condition scores for the Roanoke River in the cities of Salem and Roanoke.  This station was added to assist in defining the impact of urban NPS pollution to the Roanoke River.  It is also co-located with an ambient watershed station that indicates good water quality.  Generally, community analyses result in Non-Impaired biological condition scores. Based on the Spring 2012 VSCI score being below the impairment threshold and declining nine points from 2010, the Spring 6 year seasonal average is listed as impaired.  However, the overall 6 year average remains above the impairment threshold and yields a Non-Impaired assessment.

The Roanoke River biological monitoring station 4AROA215.13 is in a riffle with constraining features that result in a faster, deeper, larger substrate riffle than the nearest stations at 4AROA224.54 and 4AROA212.17.  4AROA224.54 is upstream and 4AROA212.17 is downstream of the station in question.  Habitat at these two comparison stations is characterized by a broad stream bed with diverse substrate and lower stream velocity.  

The best professional explanation of the lower VSCI score is attributed to difficult spring sampling conditions (greater depth and velocity); larger substrate (small boulders and bedrock) and natural variability.  The resulting low VSCI score is potentially not representative of overall water quality in this segment.  Aside from these facts, there is not an observed water quality condition that appears to cause the station to score below the impairment threshold.

Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys (2005-2006 & 2009-2010) with average score of 61.22.  Spring scores on average are lower than fall scores as a result of less total taxa present in the spring samples.  Above normal flows may have prevented high-quality samples in 2009 and 2010 and thus yielded lower VSCI scores.
