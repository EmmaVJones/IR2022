Bio 'FS' One 2004 Fall VSCI survey scoring 64.  The watershed for this station is dominated by forest.  The Falling Spring Hydro Project is upstream but the most important factor that appears to affect aquatic life is the limestone geology in the watershed.  Most of the habitat parameter scores indicate optimal conditions for macroinvertebrate colonization.  However, marl deposits on the stream substrate and high specific conductance are evidence of karst conditions which may limit the type of macroinvertebrates inhabiting the stream."

2016 IR:  Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys with an average score of 69.2.   Stream flow during the fall 2011 survey was low with substantially less substrate available to collect macroinvertebrates than the spring.  In addition, fish community sampling in the fall produced very few fish in a 150m reach.  The lack of mayflies and scrapers in the fall may indicate intermittent conditions during periods of low rainfall.  The instream habitat is exceptional and riparian vegetation provides good canopy cover and stable stream banks. Low rainfall/flow is suspected of having an impact of the benthic community in the fall.

The 2014 initial 303(d) Listing finds the benthic community impaired from a total of six Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) surveys conducted in 2008, 2009 and 2012.  The average score is 57.8 resulting in this Listing.  Initially a fall 2005 sediment discharge from a construction site prompted sampling of this site.  The 2005 fall score of 61.3 and 2006 scores spring of 50.9 and fall 60.9 caused assessment decisions to be reserved due to the improvement of scores in fall 2006 and fall 2008 (70.3).  Subsequent 2009 fall survey scored 52.8 and 2012 surveys scored spring 52.5 and fall at 64.9.  The abundance of macroinvertebrates that feed by scraping algae and periphyton (%Scrapers) has always been low indicating a lack of clean substrate or often scoured substrates.  The 2008, 2009, and 2012 habitat surveys find sand and fine sediment impact the stream substrate.  This would indicate continued sources of fines beyond the initial 2005 release.


2008,2010 & 2012 Cycle Assessments:  'J' Reserve Judgement.  Mayflies dominated the spring sample whereas; stoneflies and net-spinning caddisflies dominated the fall samples.  This station was sampled to determine the impact from an illegal discharge of sediment laden water from a holding pond at a construction site in fall 2005.  An upstream station (4ABAA023.29) was used as a control site.  Due to the improvement of scores in fall 2006 (60.9) and fall 2008 (70.3), VDEQ is reserving judgment until more data can be collected to determine whether, or not, the stream has recovered from the sediment release.
There was a moderate to severe immediate impact to the stream substrate from the sediment release.  Benthic substrates in riffles at this station were found to be 52% embedded by sand and fines in contrast to 30% embeddedness at the control site.  Immediately after the release, sediment deposition in riffles measured 3-5â€ and in pools was 8-10â€.  The impact site was nearly devoid of pool habitat due to the amount sediment deposited."

Benthic Overall Status:  'NI' This benthic community displays a recovery at this site relative to upstream stations (4ABNR000.40 and 4ABWR061.20).  Taxa richness and the abundance of pollution sensitive organisms are greater at this station.  In the spring of 2001, the site scored below the lower limit (60.0) for a non-impaired benthic community.  However, the historical scores (1998-2000)  indicate this score is an anomaly.  The previous spring and fall sample were non-impaired and the following spring sample scored non-impaired.  The impaired spring 2001 sample showed an increase in Chironomidae and a decrease in total taxa, %Ephemeroptera, and %Plecoptera and Trichoptera minus Hydropsychiidae.  The following non-impaired spring sample resulted in the opposite of this score.  In addition, a 2005 probabilistic monitoring station (4ABWR045.01) located 0.79 miles downstream scored 71.22 and 61.19 in the spring and fall, respectively.  Therefore, it is shown that the 6-yr average for this assessment period is not indicative of the condition of the benthic community at this site.  The site is assessed as non-impaired.

The results from the first year indicate the benthic community had moderate diversity and an even mix of organisms that are tolerant and sensitive to pollution.  This site was chosen as a targeted semi-annual wadeable station and VDEQ will be sampling it during even numbered years.  VDEQ is reserving judgment during this assessment cycle since biologists will be returning to the site in 2016.  The station is in a small headwater stream with low scores for habitat availability, sediment deposition, bank erosion and flow.  The stream channel is small and is naturally dominated with shallow water habitat.  The flow in the stream was either naturally low or was impacted by a pond upstream.  Rainfall and flow were higher in 2013 and 2014 compared with 2012.  Despite flow in spring and fall of both years, it appears that the stream could be intermittent or would be if the pond in the headwaters did not keep the channel supplied with water year round.  This site may not be a good candidate for assessment with VSCI."

2016 IR Bio 'IM' The 2016 data window reports eleven VSCI surveys (2009-2014) with a 6 year average score of 58.0 and 2 year score of 55.7.  The benthic macroinvertebrate community indicates a water quality pattern of recovery followed by years of decline. Overall water quality at this site remains impaired.  Recent surveys also show that the benthic community is dominated by the tolerant organisms (Hydropsychidae, Chironomidae, Pleuroceridae and Simulidae) a possible indication of organic and nutrient pollution.

2014 IR Bio 'IM' Eleven VSCI surveys (2007-2012) with average 6 year score of 54.3 and two year score of 61.2.  The station is below two hydroelectric dams resulting in daily fluctuations of flow and temperature.  Point and non-point source pollution and sediment appear to affect the river.  This station is downstream of the Lower Smith River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Henry County PSA) that closed in November 2005.  The closure did not appear to have an immediate positive affect on the benthic community.  However, since the last assessment the highest VSCI score  (68.59, Spring 2012) is recorded.  The following seasons sample declined well below the non-impaired threshold of VSCI 60 at 49.17.

Outside Data Window:
2010 IR- Bio 'IM' Seven VSCI surveys (2003-2008) with an average score of 57.4.  This station is the furthest downstream biological monitoring site and the first site where the benthic community historically showed signs of recovery.  This site has shown improvement in the Fall scores since Fall 2006, but a decline in the Fall 2008 sample.  Non-point source urban runoff and sediment appear to affect the river.  The station is located downstream of Leatherwood Creek which may be a significant source of sediment.  Recent surveys show that the benthic community is dominated by the moderately tolerant caddisfly Hydropsychidae, an indication of organic and nutrient pollution.  There was some improvement in the benthic community between 1999 and 2001, and 2006 and 2008.  Improved water quality may have been the result of operational improvements at the Martinsville WWTP.  However, the decline in benthic community scores in Spring 2006 and Fall 2008 indicates that water quality is still degraded.

Water quality in this reach is affected by NPS pollution from dairy farms from primarily the North Fork of the Blackwater River.  Habitat degradation in the form of sediment deposition and riparian vegetation removal occurs at this sight as a result of agricultural practices.  This area was affected by several drought years within the 2004 thru 2008 assessment periods.  Less runoff of nonpoint source pollution during low rainfall periods potentially resulted in an improvement in the benthic community.  Recent installation of agricultural best management practices in the watershed also contribute to improved water quality.

Riparian zone vegetation has been removed and stream banks eroded due to unrestricted cattle access to the stream.  This region was affected by several drought years in earlier assessments.  Less runoff of non-point source pollution during the low rainfall periods potentially resulted in an improvement in the benthic community.  Additionally, recent installation of agricultural best management practices in the watershed have improved water quality.

Outside Data Window:  Previous to the 2012  Integrated Report (IR) there were no additional data beyond the 2008 IR where two VSCI surveys (2001 - 2002 all Spring)  score an average of 52.8.  This site was first surveyed on 7/26/00 as part of benthic TMDL special study in the Blackwater River Watershed.  It was sampled in spring 2001 and 2002 along with the other impact sites in the North Fork of the Blackwater River.  The benthic community was dominated by several pollution tolerant organisms including midge fly larvae (Chironomidae) which are tolerant of sediment and low dissolved oxygen.  The 1999-2001 drought impacted the ecoregion reference stations at Green Creek and Pigg River resulting in a decrease in the benthic community scores.  However, the historically impaired stations in the North Fork and the Blackwater did not appear to decrease with the reference site.  Instead, some metrics (%Chironomidae, %Ephemeroptera) improved.  It appears that less runoff from adjacent fields and pastures may have helped improve the benthic community scores during the drought."

Previous surveys yielded benthic communities dominated by net-spinning caddisfly larvae (Hydropsychidae) and the fourth was dominated by midges (Chironomidae).  These organisms typically dominate streams that have high amounts of organic matter.  All surveys had lower taxa richness and diversity as well as low numbers of pollution-sensitive taxa such as mayflies and stoneflies and caddisflies. Instream habitat, riparian zone vegetation, and bank stability were all optimal providing conditions favorable for a healthy benthic community.  However, filamentous algae and periphyton growth was thick on stream substrates indicating that nutrients may be excessive in this reach of the Roanoke River.

2018 IR Bio 'IM' from six VSCI surveys (2012, 2014, 2015) with an average score of 59.5. Previous assessments observed that the benthic community declined overall from Fall 2003 to the Fall 2005 survey and that it improved during Spring and Fall 2004 before declining in the Fall of 2005.  Data collected during the 2014 assessment period show that 3 out of 4 samples were above the impairment threshold with an average VSCI score of 60.2.  Additional data collected in 2014 show an improvement in the Spring score and a decline below the impairment threshold in the Fall.  The Spring 2015 sample declined compared to the 2014 Spring score and the Fall 2015 score improved well above the impaired threshold. While the final 6-yr average is approaching the non-impaired threshold the Spring score is well below the impaired threshold.  The variability of the benthic macroinvertebrate community between Spring and Fall seasons and the consistently low Spring scores indicates stress to the community and an assessment as Impaired.

2016 IR Bio 'IM' Six VSCI surveys (2009-2010; 2012 & 2014) produce an average score of 59.7 resulting in an impaired condition.  Both spring and fall samples collected in 2009 (fall 67.6) and 2010 (spring 60.5) indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined.  One sample was below the impairment threshold (spring 2012 at 51.2) and one above (fall 2012 at 63.9).  The 2016 assessment finds all spring scores were lower than fall scores.  The 6 year average is slightly below the impairment threshold with both 2014 scores (57.0 & 59.9) below the impairment threshold of 60.

2014 IR Bio 'J' data report a 6 yr. avg. score of 60.8.  Both 2009 & 2010 spring/fall indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined.

2012 three VSCI surveys (2005 & 2009-2010) with an avg. score of 54.28.  The final 6-yr. avg. (n=3) VSCI score is driven by a fall 2005 score of 34.69.  For seven seasons samples were not collected at this station.  The eighth and ninth seasons following the 34.69 score the VSCI scores were non-impaired. More data need to be collected to determine if the 2005 impaired VSCI score is an indicator of typical water quality or an indicator of the abnormal runoff and flows during the active hurricane season of 2004.  2010 data window Bio 'IM' where four VSCI surveys (2003-2005) record impairment with an average VSCI score of 49.9.  Historically sedimentation has decreased the amount of substrate available for macroinvertebrate colonization.  Five VSCI surveys (2001-2005) average score of 51.4 finding impairment in 2008.  The benthic community declined from fall 2001 to fall 2003 and improved during spring and fall 2004.  The fall 2004 survey resulted in a non-impaired score of 65.08.

Spring bioassessments at this station show a decline since 2009 and Fall bioassessments show a slight improvement since 2009.  Overall VSCI scores are declining.  Similar to station 4ASRE031.00, this reach of the river is impacted by the operation of one hydroelectric dam, sediment deposition and urban NPS runoff.  Sediment deposition in this reach of the Smith River may negatively affect the benthic community.  This is possibly a result of the upstream scouring caused by discharges from Philpott Dam as well as inputs from major tributaries.

2012 IR:  Bio 'FS' Nine VSCI surveys (2005 - 2010) with an average six year score of 60.47 and two year score of 60.16.  This station has been the upstream control site for all Smith River biomonitoring stations and is located approximately 0.65 miles upstream of the former Upper Smith River WWTP which is currently off line.  Bioassessments at this station have shown a slight decline from the fall of 2007 to the spring of 2008 and show a recovery in the benthic macroinvertebrate community in the last sample collected.  Bioassessments at this station have shown a slight decline in the benthic macroinvertebrate community over the last several years.  Fluctuating flows from Philpott Dam have an affect on the community.  During recent surveys, it appears that sediment deposition has increased in this reach of the Smith River.  Aerial photographs have shown areas of recent logging in the Reed Creek watershed.  This is possibly a result of the upstream scouring caused by discharges from Philpott Dam as well as inputs from tributaries such as Reed Creek.

The stream surfaces from the Floyd landfill in a spring box and is impacted by growths of iron bacteria and sphaerotilus (sewage fungus).  The stream substrate was too impacted by bacterial growth to sample for benthic macroinvertebrates;  Dissolved oxygen and Specific conductance were greatly impacted where the stream exits the landfill but had recovered by the time the stream exits landfill property at the sampled site.  A May 2011 habitat survey shows most parameters are in the optimal range.  Sediment deposition was the only parameter found to be in the marginal range.  During the 2012 habitat survey, scores for sediment deposition and several other parameters had declined, some were due to lower stream flow.  The 2011 sample is dominated by mayflies, stoneflies and other generally pollution-sensitive taxa.  The dominant mayfly taxa, Ephemerellidae (50% of all organisms) is somewhat tolerant of excessive sediment and several stonefly taxa present are known to be tolerant of iron precipitate and organic enrichment. The June 2012 sample finds the number of mayflies very low but stoneflies (51%) are numerous."

SWCB approved 3/25/2013. Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys (2009-2010) with an average score of 68.22.  Based on water chemistry (field parameters and nutrients), this section of the Little River appeared to be minimally impacted by NPS pollution.  According to RBP habitat survey results, the only parameters receiving low scores were Riparian Vegetative Width and Sedimentation.  Despite these scores, the overall habitat quality indicated conditions suitable for a healthy benthic community and potential for a minimally-impacted reference station in the Interior Plateau Subecoregion.

2014 Delist Statement:  The waters are delisted with the 2014 assessment as bacteria (escherichia coli (E.coli)) excursions of the 235 cfu/100 ml instantaneous criterion are three of 35 observations.  An 8.5% exceedance rate at station 9-NEW107.51 (Allisonia USGS Gage) results in the delisting of these 1999 Consent Decree waters.  The 2004 initial 303(d) Listing is based on six of 53 fecal coliform observations exceeding the former WQS instantaneous criterion of 400 cfu/100 ml.  One of six 2004 E. coli  samples exceeded the current E.coli WQS instantaneous criterion of 235 cfu/100 ml; and were insufficient to assess as per WQS [9 VAC 25-260-170.A.1. Bacteria; other waters].  Twelve samples were required at that time to 303(d) List the parameter.  E.coli are initially Listed with the 2006 IR where four of 21 Escherichia coli (E.coli)  observations are in excess of the instantaneous criterion.  Integrated Reports (IRs) from 2006 onward 303(d) Listed these waters for contravention of the E.coli WQS instantaneous criterion.  The 2014 IR reports full support of the Recreational Use with an exceedance rate less than 10.5%.

Bio 'FS' one 2010 VSCI spring survey scoring 70.5.  This reach is sometimes dewatered in the fall resulting in limited seasonal variability in assessments.  In fall 2010, there was no water in the stream channel.  Historically, when flows are available to sample in the fall, the community consists of sensitive organisms and has been dominated by mayfly and stonefly families.  In summer 2005, a truck carrying hydrated lime wrecked in Stony Creek killing fish throughout this reach.  This reach was dry in fall 2005 and could not be sampled.  The community assemblage in the spring 2010 sample appears similar to historical springtime assemblages indicating no long-lasting effects from the truck wreck.  The stream is believed to be naturally dewatered and flows below the surface from above this site until the confluence with the New River.

The moderately pollution tolerant caddisfly family Hydropsychidae and fly family Chironomidae were the second most common macroinvertebrates during these surveys.  This community indicates the benthic community is exposed to moderate level of pollution, possibly a nutrient source that provides the Hydropsychidae the opportunity to be second most dominant.  Thus, this stream reach shows evidence of yearlong pollution.  Habitat condition at this station is suboptimal, impacted by sediment and poor riparian vegetation zones.  The mostly open canopy allows for increased water temperatures and primary production resulting in large mats of algae and bacteria on the stream substrate during the summer and fall.
