This station is located below the confluence of the Jackson and Cowpasture Rivers and shows improvement in water quality due to the distance from industrial and municipal point sources in Covington and Clifton Forge, as well as urban NPS pollution.
2010 IR-Bio 'FS' Five VSCI surveys spanning from 2003 to 2007 (2005 no sample).   Compared to the historical upstream control site, there was a slight difference in the average Stream Condition Index VSCI scores 68.6 at this station versus 78.0 at 2-JKS030.65.  

2006 Cycle:  One exceeding pH (4/06/99 - 9.2) value is excluded from the dataset as the pH meter probe was malfunctioning.  Memo from G. Devlin 10/21/03."

The invertebrate community at this site has been dominated by taxa that are tolerant of environments with low dissolved oxygen and high levels of organic pollution (i.e. Tubificidae, Tricladida, Chironomidae, Lumbriculidae, and Simulidae).  Spring scores on average were higher than fall scores.  However, there were only two samples collected in the spring during this assessment period.  The VSCI scores display a negative alteration in the taxonomic diversity and pollution sensitivity of the benthic community.

2016 IR Bio 'IM' six VSCI surveys (2010-2014) with an average score of 32.8.  One spring (2010 score of 27.84 ) and five fall surveys (2010-2014 avg. score of 33.8) lie within the 2016 data window.  The invertebrate community at this site has been dominated by taxa that are tolerant of environments with low dissolved oxygen and high levels of organic pollution (i.e. Tubificidae, Tricladida, Chironomidae, Lumbriculidae, and Simulidae).  Spring scores on average were higher than fall scores.  However, there were only two samples collected in the spring during this assessment period.  The VSCI scores display a negative alteration in the taxonomic diversity and pollution sensitivity of the benthic community.

Benthic Overall Status:  'NI' This benthic community displays a recovery at this site relative to upstream stations (4ABNR000.40 and 4ABWR061.20).  Taxa richness and the abundance of pollution sensitive organisms are greater at this station.  In the spring of 2001, the site scored below the lower limit (60.0) for a non-impaired benthic community.  However, the historical scores (1998-2000) indicate this score is an anomaly.  The previous spring and fall sample were non-impaired and the following spring sample scored non-impaired.  The impaired spring 2001 sample showed an increase in Chironomidae and a decrease in total taxa, %Ephemeroptera, and %Plecoptera and Trichoptera minus Hydropsychiidae.  The following non-impaired spring sample resulted in the opposite of this score.  In addition, a 2005 probabilistic monitoring station (4ABWR045.01) located 0.79 miles downstream scored 71.22 and 61.19 in the spring and fall, respectively.  Therefore, it is shown that the 6-yr average for this assessment period is not indicative of the condition of the benthic community at this site.  The site is assessed as non-impaired.

Bio 'IM' Five (2009-2011) VSCI surveys.  The average VSCI score is 47.1 indicating an impaired condition.  Instream habitat (substrate) has been impacted by fine sediment.  Riparian zone vegetation has been removed and stream banks eroded due to unrestricted cattle access to the stream.  This region was affected by several drought years in earlier assessments.  Less runoff of non-point source pollution during the low rainfall periods potentially resulted in an improvement in the benthic community.  Additionally, recent installation of agricultural best management practices in the watershed have improved water quality.  The Soil and Water Conservation District is implementing agricultural best management practices in the watershed.

This site was first surveyed on 7/26/00 as part of benthic TMDL special study in the Blackwater River Watershed.  It was sampled in spring 2001 and 2002 along with the other impact sites in the North Fork of the Blackwater River.  The benthic community was dominated by several pollution tolerant organisms including midge fly larvae (Chironomidae) which are tolerant of sediment and low dissolved oxygen.  The 1999-2001 drought impacted the ecoregion reference stations at Green Creek and Pigg River resulting in a decrease in the benthic community scores.  However, the historically impaired stations in the North Fork and the Blackwater did not appear to decrease with the reference site.  Instead, some metrics (%Chironomidae, %Ephemeroptera) improved.  It appears that less runoff from adjacent fields and pastures may have helped improve the benthic community scores during the drought.","2014/2016/2018 Cycle:  North Fork Blackwater River Bacteria TMDL Study U.S. EPA approved 03/09/2001.

Three surveys had benthic communities dominated by net-spinning caddisfly larvae (Hydropsychidae) and the fourth was dominated by midges (Chironomidae).  Instream habitat, riparian zone vegetation, and bank stability were all optimal providing conditions favorable for a healthy benthic community.  However, filamentous algae and periphyton growth is thick on stream substrates indicating that nutrients may be excessive in this reach of the Roanoke River.","2018 Cycle: 2016 flow adjusted trend analysis finds improving pH trend.

2018 IR Bio 'IM' from 6 VSCI surveys (2012, 2014, 2015) with an average score of 59.5. Previous assessments observed that the benthic community declined overall from Fall 2003 to the Fall 2005 survey and that it improved during Spring and Fall 2004 before declining in the Fall of 2005. Data collected during the 2014 assessment period show that 3/4 samples were above the impairment threshold with an average VSCI score of 60.2. Additional data collected in 2014 show an improvement in the Spring score and a decline below the impairment threshold in the Fall. The Spring 2015 sample declined compared to the 2014 Spring score and the Fall 2015 score improved well above the impaired threshold. While the 6-yr avg is approaching the non-impaired threshold, the Spring score is well below the impaired threshold. The variability of the benthic community between Spring and Fall seasons and the consistently low Spring scores indicates stress and an impaired benthic community.

2016 IR Bio 'IM' 6 VSCI surveys (2009-2010; 2012 & 2014) produce an avg score of 59.7 resulting in an impaired condition. Both spring and fall samples collected in 2009 (fall 67.6) and 2010 (spring 60.5) indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined. One sample was below the impairment threshold (spring 2012 - 51.2) and one above (fall 2012 - 63.9). The 2016 assessment finds all spring scores were lower than fall scores. The 6 year avg is slightly below the impairment threshold with both 2014 scores (57.0 & 59.9) below the impairment threshold of 60.

2014 IR Bio 'J' data report a 6 yr. avg. score of 60.8. Both 2009 & 2010 spring/fall indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined.

For 7 seasons samples were not collected at this station. The eighth and ninth seasons the VSCI scores were non-impaired.

2018 IR Bio 'IM' from six VSCI surveys (2012, 2014, 2015) with an average score of 59.5. Previous assessments observed that the benthic community declined overall from Fall 2003 to the Fall 2005 survey and that it improved during Spring and Fall 2004 before declining in the Fall of 2005.  Data collected during the 2014 assessment period show that 3 out of 4 samples were above the impairment threshold with an average VSCI score of 60.2.  Additional data collected in 2014 show an improvement in the Spring score and a decline below the impairment threshold in the Fall.  The Spring 2015 sample declined compared to the 2014 Spring score and the Fall 2015 score improved well above the impaired threshold. While the final 6-yr average is approaching the non-impaired threshold the Spring score is well below the impaired threshold.  The variability of the benthic macroinvertebrate community between Spring and Fall seasons and the consistently low Spring scores indicates stress to the community and an assessment as Impaired.

2016 IR Bio 'IM' Six VSCI surveys (2009-2010; 2012 & 2014) produce an average score of 59.7 resulting in an impaired condition.  Both spring and fall samples collected in 2009 (fall 67.6) and 2010 (spring 60.5) indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined.  One sample was below the impairment threshold (spring 2012 at 51.2) and one above (fall 2012 at 63.9).  The 2016 assessment finds all spring scores were lower than fall scores.  The 6 year average is slightly below the impairment threshold with both 2014 scores (57.0 & 59.9) below the impairment threshold of 60.

2014 IR Bio 'J' data report a 6 yr. avg. score of 60.8.  Both 2009 & 2010 spring/fall indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined.

2012 three VSCI surveys (2005 & 2009-2010) with an avg. score of 54.28.  The final 6-yr. avg. (n=3) VSCI score is driven by a fall 2005 score of 34.69.  For seven seasons samples were not collected at this station.  The eighth and ninth seasons following the 34.69 score the VSCI scores were non-impaired. More data need to be collected to determine if the 2005 impaired VSCI score is an indicator of typical water quality or an indicator of the abnormal runoff and flows during the active hurricane season of 2004.  2010 data window Bio 'IM' where four VSCI surveys (2003-2005) record impairment with an average VSCI score of 49.9.  Historically sedimentation has decreased the amount of substrate available for macroinvertebrate colonization.  Five VSCI surveys (2001-2005) average score of 51.4 finding impairment in 2008.  The benthic community declined from fall 2001 to fall 2003 and improved during spring and fall 2004.  The fall 2004 survey resulted in a non-impaired score of 65.08.  This is the highest VSCI score found at this station.

Bio 'J' Four VSCI surveys (2010 & 2012) surveys with a score of 59.1.  This station was sampled to determine the impacts from a lime truck spill occurring in June 2005.  NPS runoff from a lime plant across the road may periodically impact this site.  This site also has a narrow riparian buffer between the stream and Rt. 635.  Numerous residences along the stream between the National Forest boundary and this station possibly contribute NPS pollution.  Lime scale is noticeable on rocks in and along the stream and filamentous algae has been prevalent at this station but not at others in Stony Creek.  The station was sampled in 2010 and 2012 after citizen complaints about potential runoff from a lime plant/quarry.  Compared to upstream and downstream sites on Stony Creek the benthic community at this station has lower VSCI scores that appear to be driven partially by feeding modes of the organisms.  There are usually lower numbers of organisms that are called Scrapers (scrape periphyton from clean substrates) and higher numbers of Hydropsychid caddisflies which are filter feeders (build nets to collect fine organic matter).  During the past few assessment cycles, the average VSCI has declined.

The Spring 2018 samples indicated a decline in water quality.  High flows during Fall 2018 prevented samples from being collected.  Total Habitat scores are indicating a slight decline in habitat quality. 2016 IR adds two VSCI scores of 70.3 and 68.7 for an average of 73.8 from four surveys (2009-2014).

The kill began approximately five miles upstream in an unnamed tributary and extended into Stroubles Creek, a half mile downstream from this site. Although the source was not found, pesticides were suspected. Follow up monitoring was performed to test for recovery of the benthic community.  The abundance of organisms in the spring 2006 sample was very low relative to the reference site.

Bio 'FS' one 2010 VSCI spring survey scoring 70.5.  This reach is sometimes dewatered in the fall resulting in limited seasonal variability in assessments.  In fall 2010, there was no water in the stream channel.  Historically, when flows are available to sample in the fall, the community consists of sensitive organisms and has been dominated by mayfly and stonefly families.  In summer 2005, a truck carrying hydrated lime wrecked in Stony Creek killing fish throughout this reach.  This reach was dry in fall 2005 and could not be sampled.  The community assemblage in the spring 2010 sample appears similar to historical springtime assemblages indicating no long-lasting effects from the truck wreck.  The stream is believed to be naturally dewatered and flows below the surface from above this site until the confluence with the New River.

The moderately pollution tolerant caddisfly family Hydropsychidae and fly family Chironomidae were the second most common macroinvertebrates during these surveys.  This community indicates the benthic community is exposed to moderate level of pollution, possibly a nutrient source that provides the Hydropsychidae the opportunity to be second most dominant.  Thus, this stream reach shows evidence of yearlong pollution.  Habitat condition at this station is suboptimal, impacted by sediment and poor riparian vegetation zones.  The mostly open canopy allows for increased water temperatures and primary production resulting in large mats of algae and bacteria on the stream substrate during the summer and fall.

Bio 'IM' One 2008 VSCI survey scoring 56.5.  This station was sampled as part of the Nutrient Criteria Special Study in 2008.  Stations were selected based on historical nutrient levels and data on benthic macroinvertebrates, algae, periphyton and habitat were collected to be compared with nutrients.  The VSCI score indicates a stressed community with low taxonomic diversity and low abundance of pollution-sensitive organisms.  Habitat surveys indicated a stream section with substrates that were impacted by excessive fine sediments.  Chemical analyses indicate high phosphorus levels.  Elevated TP values, greater than 0.20 mg/l, are found in nine of 16 samples.  The elevated values range from 0.21 to 0.68 mg/l.

Bio 'IM' One 2008 VSCI survey scoring 56.5.  This station was sampled as part of the Nutrient Criteria Special Study in 2008.  Stations were selected based on historical nutrient levels and data on benthic macroinvertebrates, algae, periphyton and habitat were collected to be compared with nutrients.  The VSCI score indicates a stressed community with low taxonomic diversity and low abundance of pollution-sensitive organisms.  Habitat surveys indicated a stream section with substrates that were impacted by excessive fine sediments.  Chemical analyses indicate high phosphorus levels.  Elevated TP values, greater than 0.20 mg/l, are found in nine of 16 samples.  The elevated values range from 0.21 to  0.68 mg/l.

Two 2011 VSCI surveys were unsuitable for assessment. The benthic assemblage collected at this site indicates tolerance to acid stream conditions (pH = 5.4) as well as intermittent/headwater stream conditions (low numbers of mayflies and low %Scrapers).  The spring sample resulted in only 12 organisms collected in a 2 m2 area of substrate; whereas, several hundred organisms are typically collected with similar effort.  Due to the low number collected, an assessment score could not be calculated.  The fall 2010 sample had a low density of benthic macroinvertebrates but enough to calculate an SCI score.  This assemblage was dominated by Stoneflies from the family Capniidae (genus Allocapnia) which are tolerant of acid conditions and intermittent stream flow.  
The stream substrates at this site were stuck together by what appeared to be iron bacteria that had dried when the stream was dry.  Local residents said the stream was dry until a rain event one-two weeks prior to the fall 2010 survey.  The VSCI was not designed to assess intermittent streams and therefore is not a valid assessment of this portion of Mill Cr."

The station is located in the front yard of a residence near the headwaters of the stream.  Upstream of the station the land cover is dominated by forest.  However, shortly above the sample site, the property had historically been used as a saw mill but that area is currently vegetated.  The stream currently flows through two culverts that allow for driveway crossings immediately above the sample reach.  Within the sample reach, the stream has poor instream habitat as indicated by mostly low scores for substrate, velocity, and sediment.  The channel has been altered from its natural shape.  The immediate bank vegetation is mowed down to the water line and the riparian vegetation has been completely removed.  Despite the habitat impacts, the benthic community, in most samples, consisted of pollution sensitive taxa.

This station has a WQS stream class designation of Class V; located in AU VAW-L03R_ROA02A00.  A downstream Class IV AU VAW-L03R_ROA01A00 is assessed using the data of 4AROA212.17. 

Additional temperature data needed for delist; Aquatic Life Use remains impaired for temperature.  Two of 17 Temp measurements exceed the 21°C criterion within the 2010 data window.  Measurements in excess of the criterion: 21.3 on 7/15/2003 and 25.4 on 7/13/2004. Originally Listed 2002 for temperature (11/67).

No additional E.coli data beyond the 2010 IR where four of 23 escherichia coli (E.coli) samples exceed the 235 cfu/100 ml WQS instantaneous criterion.  E.coli excursions range from 290 to 750 cfu/100 ml. 

Only 2008 SPMD data will be used in the assessment.  ROA PCB TM SPMD-'S' both samples below the new WQS criterion of 640 pg/l on 3/3/2008 @ 80 pg/l and 4/7/2008 @ 256 pg/l.

4AROA212.17 Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys with an average score of 64.9.

Std. - Benthic Partial Delist of the Roanoke from the Salem City water intake downstream to the confluence of Murray Run.  Encompasses AUs VAW-L03R_ROA02A00, VAW-L03R_ROA01A00, VAW-L04R_ROA08A02 and VAW-L04R_ROA07A00; a total of 9.41 miles.

4AROA215.13- Bio 'FS'  Three VSCI spring surveys (2009, 2010 & 2012) and one 2012 Fall score of 72.2; with an average score of 62.9.  Benthic community analyses result in good biological condition scores for the Roanoke River in the cities of Salem and Roanoke.  This station was added to assist in defining the impact of urban NPS pollution to the Roanoke River.  It is also co-located with an ambient watershed station that indicates good water quality.  Generally, community analyses result in Non-Impaired biological condition scores. Based on the Spring 2012 VSCI score being below the impairment threshold and declining nine points from 2010, the Spring 6 year seasonal average is listed as impaired.  However, the overall 6 year average remains above the impairment threshold and yields a Non-Impaired assessment.

The Roanoke River biological monitoring station 4AROA215.13 is in a riffle with constraining features that result in a faster, deeper, larger substrate riffle than the nearest stations at 4AROA224.54 and 4AROA212.17.  4AROA224.54 is upstream and 4AROA212.17 is downstream of the station in question.  Habitat at these two comparison stations is characterized by a broad stream bed with diverse substrate and lower stream velocity.  

The best professional explanation of the lower VSCI score is attributed to difficult spring sampling conditions (greater depth and velocity); larger substrate (small boulders and bedrock) and natural variability.  The resulting low VSCI score is potentially not representative of overall water quality in this segment.  Aside from these facts, there is not an observed water quality condition that appears to cause the station to score below the impairment threshold.

Outside Data Window: 
Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys (2005-2006 & 2009-2010) with average score of 61.22.  Spring scores on average are lower than fall scores as a result of less total taxa present in the spring samples.  Above normal flows may have prevented high-quality samples in 2009 and 2010 and thus yielded lower VSCI scores. 
Four VSCI Surveys 2003 Fall; 2004 Spring; 2005 Spring & 2006 Fall)  for 2010 assessment = NI.  Spring scores on average are lower than fall scores.
